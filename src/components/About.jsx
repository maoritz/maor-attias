      Hi, I’m Maor Attias, a passionate Web Developer with a focus on creating clean, modern, and user-friendly web applications. With a background in JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS, I love building projects that solve real-world problems while offering an intuitive and seamless user experience. <br /> <br /> I started my web development journey because of my love for technology and problem-solving. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills by working on various projects, from weather apps to more complex platforms like recipe sharing platforms. My goal is to continuously learn and grow as a developer, always keeping up with the latest technologies and best practices. <br /> <br /> When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring the outdoors, staying updated with tech trends, or thinking about my next big project. <br /> <br /> Let’s build something great together!
